# Angular
<div>
  <div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
    <div>
      <img src="/assets/angular.png">
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Created and maintained by Google, plus open-source community</li>
        <li>Built on Typescript and you are expected to use it</li>
        <li>"Javascript inserted into your HTML"</li>
        <li>Batteries included option. You need to build it the angular way
          <ul>
            <li>Benefit of standard development and structure --> Easy to find examples that work for your use case</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use-case: larger organizations with larger applications.
          <ul>
            <li>Some state this isn't great for new devs, but I disagree</li>
          </ul>

# React

      <img src="/assets/react.png">
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Created and maintained by Facebook (Meta), plus open-source community</li>
        <li>"HTML inserted into your Javascript"</li>
        <li>Not as much out of the box and a lot of flexibility. Means you may also need a lot of other libraries or tools with React
          <ul>
            <li>A lot of tutorials and examples online, however, they can often only work for the context of that example.s</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use-case: smaller applications with smaller teams (<i>meh...</i>)
          <ul>
            <li>Less experienced developers, a ton of documentation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Created and maintained by Evan You (ex-Google), plus open-source community</li>
        <li>Smallest community and similar to angular in that you can structure it how you want
          <ul>
            <li>Difficulties finding examples (compared to Angular and React)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use-case: want to use something not run by a major tech company and newer. Great for early starters</li>

# Demo - Project Overview

    <li>HTTP Request</li>
    <li>Styling</li>
    <li>State Management</li>

# Demo - Lessons Learned
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>Understanding that there are two different approaches to developing components in react is important. There would be times I would read an article, just to find out that it was in the wrong approach, ultimately moved to function components.</li>
    <li>Redux was a bit challenging as far as a state management library... This was much easier from Angular experience because we could just create Observables and then subscribe to those observables. This is a bit easier to understand than something like Redux, which is a full blown/master state management library.</li>
    <li>xstate was a bit easier to learn than redux. This could easily been because I did a lot of learning with redux that I was able to carry over to xstate.</li>
    <li>I like the fact that in both vue and react that everything can be easily integrated into a single file. With angular, it seems like you need to be jumping between a lot of different files.</li>
    <li>Angular can be nice because it removes some decision making that can easily get in the way. You can easily run into decision fatigue with the other options. Also means that online resources are a lot nicer to use because they all use the "angular way", vs vue and react have so many different ways that you can solve the same problem.</li>
  </ol>

# Fun Experiment
<div>
  <h2>Chat GPT</h2>
  <p>See what happens when I ask chatgpt for my presentation, just for fun</p>
</div>

---

# Conclussion
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>Easier than I thought to move from one to the other. A lot of the same principles across them all</li>
    <li>State management was definitely the most difficult part across the board</li>
    <li>I like different things about each of them</li>
  </ol>

# Code

Use code snippets and get the highlighting directly![^1]

```ts {all|2|1-6|9|all}
interface User {
  id: number
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  role: string
}

function updateUser(id: number, update: User) {
  const user = getUser(id)
  const newUser = { ...user, ...update }
  saveUser(id, newUser)
}

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

<div>

```html
<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" />
```

<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" scale="0.65" />

</div>
</div>

<!--
Presenter note with **bold**, *italic*, and ~~striked~~ text.

Also, HTML elements are valid:
<div class="flex w-full">
  <span style="flex-grow: 1;">Left content</span>
  <span>Right content</span>
</div>

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="-t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default

```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
